# Flexible Boxes

This repository contains the code for the "Flexible Boxes" assignment completed for CMPT 213 with Dr. Brian Fraser. The assignment consists of two parts:

## Java Swing GUI for Drawing Boxes
- Implemented a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.
- Allows users to draw and manipulate boxes based on JSON file descriptions.
- Features include dynamic modification of box properties such as border style, fill type, and background color.

## Spring Boot REST API Integration
- Developed a REST API using Spring Boot to integrate the GUI with a web client.
- Enables remote access and interaction with the box drawing application.
- Users can create, modify, and export box configurations via HTTP requests.

The project demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, GUI development, and web application integration while adhering to object-oriented design principles.
